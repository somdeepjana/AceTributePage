                is both a fictional character and tritagonist of the One Piece series.
                He was the adopted older brother of Luffy and Sabo,
                and son of the late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger and his lover, Portgas D. Rouge.
                He was adopted by Monkey D. Garp as wished by Roger to him before his birth,
                and Ace chose and took his mother's surname "Portgas" after the death of his father.
